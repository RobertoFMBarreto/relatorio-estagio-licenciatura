@book{dart,
  abstract  = {Factory (87) Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. Builder (97) Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations. Factory Method (107) Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses. Prototype (117) Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype. Singleton (127) Ensure a class only has one instance, and provide a global point of access to it. Structural Patterns Adapter (139) Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces. Bridge (151) Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently. Composite (163) Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. Decorator (175) Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality. Facade (185) Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use. Flyweight (195) Use sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently. Proxy (207) Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.},

  abstract  = {Developing a new web application should not mean reinventing the wheel. Thats why a framework is an essential item in your development toolbox. It helps you respect coding standards; write bulletproof, maintainable code; and focus on business rules rather than waste time on repetitive tasks. This book introduces you to symfony, the leading framework for PHP developers, showing you how to wield its many features to develop web applications faster and more efficiently, efile:///E:/MAESTRIA/Documentos/Tesis Wilson.pdfven if you only know a bit of PHP. In The Definitive Guide to symfony, you will learn about the Model-View-Controller architecture and the crucial role it plays in making frameworks like symfony possible. The book also covers framework installation and configuration, and shows you how to build pages, deal with templates, manage requests and sessions, and communicate with databases and servers. You will see how symfony can make your life easier by effectively managing form data, enhancing the user experience with Ajax, internationalizing applications for a global audience, and using smart URLs. Authors François Zaninotto and Fabien Potencier put a strong emphasis on the tools that symfony provides for professional environments, showing you how to take advantage of unit tests, scaffolding, plug-ins, the command line, and extensible configuration. And since frameworks often raise performance-related debate, this book will give you many tips and techniques for monitoring and improving your applications performance, from caching to expert configuration tweaks. Always keen to offer practical instruction, the authors include lots of code examples, expert tips, best practices, and illustrations throughout this book, with the goal of providing a resource that satisfies the educational needs of symfony's rapidly growing user community.},

No knowledge of database programming or administration is necessary. PostgreSQL is one of the most powerful and easy-to-use database management systems. It supports the most advanced features included in the SQL standards. The book starts with an intruduction to relational databases with PostgreSQL. It then moves on to cover data definition language (DDL), with an emphasis on PostgreSQL and common DDL commands supported by ANSI SQL. You will then learn data manipulation language (DML) and advanced topics such as locking and performance tuning. This will give you a very robust background to tune and troubleshoot your application. The book then covers the implementation of data models in the database, such as creating tables, setting up integrity constraints, building indexes, defining views, and other schema objects. Next, it will give you an overview of the NoSQL capabilities of PostgreSQL, along with Hstore, XML, JSON and arrays. By the end of the book, you'll learn to use the JDBC driver and manipulate data objects in the Hibernate framework.},
